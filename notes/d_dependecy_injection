This also known as IOC inversion of control.
    Flexible Loosely coupled components
    Easier Testing

Micronaut Inject
    Inspired by Spring DI & google dagger

    Design goals
        use reflicetion
        optimize start up time
        reduce memroy foot print



Dependency Injection -

        Consturctor
        MyService service;
        HelloworldController(HelloworldService hws){
        }


        @Primary
        @Singleton -> [Spring @Service]
        myMyService implements MyService;


        @Singleton
        mySecondaryService implents MyService;

        field based injection
        @Inject

Note -> its recommended to use constructer based injection
Note  -> incase of multiple  possible bean candidate we can resolve that by setting primary
