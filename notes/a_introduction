to create new application with
https://micronaut.io/launch

creating controller ->

@Controller("/hello")
@Get

we can set media type ->
@Get(produce = MediaType.Text)


Why micronaut is fast ?
-> micronaut does all the injection in the run time, spring boot does all the injection in compile time.
and when we start the appliacation spring boot does lots of injection at run time.


micronaut build time is high and startup time is low
