One of the design goals of Micronaut was to eliminate the artificial separation imposed by
traditional frameworks between function and unit tests due to slow startup times and memory consumption.



@MicronautTest -> this triggers micronaut test handling, micronaut server will start and stop the test suit
                    if we dont add it then it will be normal test.

@Test

Controller tests->


we can use HttpClient provided by micronaut for rest calls and there reponse tests.
    @Inject
    @Client("/")
    HttpClient client;

      var response = client.toBlocking().exchange("/say_hello", String.class);
